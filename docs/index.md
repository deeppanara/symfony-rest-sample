# Preface

In this tutorial, we will build a simple RESTful API application using Symfony and the latest PHP 8.

## Audience

I assume you have some basic knowledge of PHP language, esp. the OOP programming feature since PHP 5.2. 

If you know well about other OOP program languages, such as Java and C#, it is easy to migrate to the latest PHP progamming. 

In fact, Zend Framework, Symfony and Doctrine are heavily inspired by Java frameworks, such as Spring and JPA/Hibernate.

In this tutorial, we will utilize the latest PHP 8 features to cook the sample application. 

## Sample Codes

The sample codes of this tutorial are available on Github. Get a copy of the source codes, and explore them yourself.

In short, you can clone the project from Github via GIT command line.

```bash 
$ git clone https://github.com/hantsy/symfony-rest-sample
```
