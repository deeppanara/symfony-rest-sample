# Data Accessing with Doctrine

[Doctrine ORM](https://www.doctrine-project.org) is a popular ORM framework in PHP world, which is highly inspired by the existing Java ORM frameworks, esp. JPA specification and Hibernate.

There are two core components in Doctrine project:

* `doctrine/dbal` is a low-level abstraction layer for database operations, imagine it is the *Jdbc* role in Java world.
* `doctrine/orm` is the advanced ORM framework which public APIs are similar to JPA/Hibernate. 

Nowadays Doctrine includes a lot of PHP libraries.  In this tutorial we mainly use ORM components.
